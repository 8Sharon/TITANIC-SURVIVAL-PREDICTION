# Titanic survival prediction 

# Introduction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the Random Forest Classifier, we can analyze various features of passengers to determine their likelihood of survival.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information about the passengers, such as:

Passenger Class (Pclass)

Name

Sex

Age

SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)

Parch (number of parents/children aboard)

Ticket

Fare

Cabin

Embarked

# Model Training
The primary machine learning model used in this project is the Random Forest Classifier. The data preprocessing step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the data.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
